    "This are probability functions that can assume discrete numbers as values, they are also called `probability mass functions`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Continuous Probability Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the probability functin that describes scenerios where a variable can assume infinite values between two value points. Continuous variables are values that can be divivded into smaller portions and expressed in fractions and decimals, example weights, height and temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike discrete probability distributions where each particular value has a non-zero likelihood, specific values in continuous distributions have a zero probability. For example, the likelihood of measuring a temperature that is exactly 32 degrees is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Consider that the temperature can be an infinite number of other temperatures that are infinitesimally higher or lower than 32. Statisticians say that an individual value has an infinitesimally small probability that is equivalent to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to measure the probability of a continuous data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike discrete data where we can measure the probaility of a value since we know the total sum of the data, in continuous data sets the limit is infinite hence we user a probability distribution graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The area under a probability plots is 1(total area that is), the propotion of the area under a specific range(alogn the X-axis) of values indicate the probability that a value will fall under that range.\n",
    "\n",
